## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="./imgs/photo.jpg">

- I am a researcher working in the low-power mixed-signal integrated circuit and systems. I am especailly interested in the circuit design for bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and sensor technology.

- You can find my publications on [Google Scholar]([https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=7QvWnzMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SiProigAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhikai-Huang).
